Rewrite of my csgo chat bot

A chatbot for CS:GO that reads the CS:GO console over telnet. The chat commands can be sent using the chat or the console.

Huge thanks to [@403-Fruit](https://github.com/403-Fruit) for sharing [this project](https://github.com/403-Fruit/csctl)! The project helped me a lot when figuring out how to do things.

## Setup

Add the following to the CS:GO launch options:

    -netconport 2121  
    
Add your Steam and faceit API keys to the `config.py` file to get the `!info` command to work fully:

    steam_api_key = '' # Steam web API key here to get steam/game stats
    faceit_api_key = '' # Faceit API key here to get faceit levels

Run the chat bot:

    python csbot.py

## Chat commands

    !help              - Prints out the list of avaible commands to the chat

    !info <name>       - Tries to get <name>'s game stats including: K/D ratio, Play time and 
                         total rounds played on the current map.

    !github            - Prints a link to this repository

    !dz                - Prints the current and next danger zone map

    !calc <expression> - Calculates the math expression in <math> and returns the answer
                         Example:
                           !calc (5 + 5) * 2

    !mute <string>     - Adds the string to the clear list
                         The bot will send a chat clear message when it detects the string in the chat name or message

    !unmute <string>   - Removes the string from the clear list

## Console commands

    !info              - Get the info table containing all the players manually
                         This prints the whole table in easy to read format to the cmd

    !dz_map            - Toggles the auto notification for dz map changes

    !dz                - Echoes the current and next danger zone map

    !zeus_shot         - Does the zeus shot visual bug where you can shoot the zeus wires from your currently held weapon
                         This is only visible for other players

    !lowjump           - Performs the lowjump consistently for some pixelsurfs
